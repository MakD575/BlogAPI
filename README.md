A JavaScript Project that allows users to create, edit, and delete personal blog posts. This project does not utilize a database so the posts are not persistent between sessions.
Open up the terminal and run 'nodemon index.js' in order to initialize the app. It contains the code to set up your routes, middlewares, and controllers.
Afterwards run 'nodemon server.js' to start the server.
